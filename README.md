# excel-table-calc

Create an application that takes an Excel file as input and outputs another Excel file with a table based on specified calculations. The application should filter data to consider only rows where 'IS Seriennummer' == 1, calculate the total sum and the number of modules for each customer, categorize customers based on the number of modules, and integrate an easy validation to output a new table with validation results. The initial table and method provided by the user will be used as a basis for developing the application. Additionally, the application should write a new table with validation results regarding the input data's integrity and completeness.
